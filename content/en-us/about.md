## Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my blog! My name is **João Pedro Sconetto**, and I'm passionate about technology, software development, photography, gaming, racing and much more.
I created this blog as a way to to some ideas out there, to the world, in hopes that I can end up sharing at least a speck of knowledge with the community.

## About Me

I'm a Software Engineer, by graduation, but have been working a lot as a leader/manager in the past years. I love exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, and building things, being that a raspberry pi with batocera installed or just an arduino as a real-time clock (sometimes I also build some legos).

## What I Do

Currently, I work as a team leader at Joby Aviation where I focus mainly on factory systems. I'm particularly interested in:

- People Management
- Python
- Code Quality
- Innovative Architectures
- CI/CD

## Skills & Technologies

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

**Languages & Frameworks:**

- Python
- Javascript
- React/Vue
- Ansible
- Docker
- Shell Scripting
- HTML/XML/JSON
- And in lower degree with some side projects (Golang, Rust, Ruby)

**Tools & Platforms:**

- Raycast
- Cursor
- Fork (Git/GitHub)
- GitHub Actions
- Datadog
- Notion
- PSQL
- Databricks
- Slack

## Interests

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:

- Music 🎵 🎸
